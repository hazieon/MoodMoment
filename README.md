# Mind Moment

Take a Mind Moment.

A mental health app aiming to help people increase their awareness of their emotions with the goal of increasing control and mindfullness through visuals and virtual activities. 

The MVP will be a landing page with an interactive colour picker that presents the user with different activities depending on their input.

The initial prototype of the app may be built with no-code Bubble.io to build out the idea.
